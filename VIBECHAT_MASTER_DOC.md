# VibeChat: The Master Documentation

## Your Group Chat. Your Rules. Your Vibe.

**Version:** 1.0
**Tagline:** Messaging reimagined for the AI generation.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**VibeChat** is not just another messaging app; it is a **social operating system** designed for the AI-native generation. It solves the two fundamental problems of modern group chats: **Chaos** (too much noise, FOMO, planning nightmares) and **Boredom** (stale conversations, lack of utility).

By integrating a customizable **AI Friend** directly into the chat as a participant—not a support bot—VibeChat transforms passive scrolling into active creation. We call this philosophy **"Vibe Chatting"**: giving users the tools to architect their own social reality, from the personality of their AI companion to the logic of their conversation threads.

**The Promise:** Zero FOMO. Infinite Creativity. A chat that feels like a place you *want* to hang out, not a chore you have to check.

## 2. The Core Philosophy: "Vibe Chatting"

We believe that every group chat is a unique universe with its own culture, inside jokes, and needs. VibeChat provides the toolkit to build that universe.

* **The Architect:** You don't just chat; you design the experience.
* **No-Code Creation:** You don't need to be a developer to build powerful tools. Use natural language to program your AI's personality and create custom slash commands.
* **Fluid Reality:** The app adapts to the group. A startup team's chat functions differently than a D&D group's chat, powered by the same underlying engine.

---

## 3. Key Features & Superpowers

VibeChat is built on six core pillars of functionality, designed to empower every member of the group.

### 🧠 1. The Architect (Custom AI Personalities)

* **Function:** Every chat comes with a built-in AI member (powered by GPT-5) that lives in the group.
* **Customization:** The group creator can "code" the AI's personality.
  * **Name:** Give it a name (e.g., "Jarvis", "The Dungeon Master", "Roasted Bot").
  * **Personality Prompt:** Define how it acts (e.g., "You are a ruthless 1980s stockbroker," "You are a supportive therapist," "You are a chaotic hype-man").
  * **Tone:** Select from presets like Professional, Chill, Unhinged, or Sarcastic.
* **Capability:** The AI "sees" images (via GPT-Vision), remembers context (last 100 messages), and participates naturally without needing to be pinged constantly (via Smart Engagement).
* **Tools:** Equipped with **Web Search** (for real-time info) and **Image Generation** (for visual expression), allowing it to fetch live data or create art on demand.

### 🛠️ 2. The Engineer (Custom Slash Commands)

* **Function:** Users can build their own chat tools using natural language prompts.
* **How it Works:** Define a trigger (e.g., `/roast`) and an instruction (e.g., "Insult the user based on their last message").
* **Multi-Tool Power:** Commands can intelligently invoke:
  * **Web Search:** `/factcheck` (Search Google for the truth).
  * **Image Gen:** `/visualize` (Generate DALL-E 3 art).
  * **Data Analysis:** `/analyze` (Parse CSVs or text).
* **Examples:**
  * `/bet` -> "Check the odds for the game mentioned."
  * `/translate` -> "Translate to Gen Z slang."
  * `/dnd_roll` -> "Roll a d20 and describe the outcome dramatically."

### 🎬 3. The Director (Smart Threads)

* **Function:** Intelligent noise control.
* **The Problem:** Important plans get lost in memes.
* **The Solution:** Create **Smart Threads** that filter the main chat view.
  * **Logic Gates:** Filter by Topic ("Gaming", "Work"), Keywords ("Dinner", "Time"), or People.
  * **Unified Timeline:** Messages sent in threads still appear in the main chat (no hidden pockets), but you can *view* the chat through a filtered lens to see only what matters.
  * **Use Case:** Switch to the "Plans" thread to see only logistics, ignoring the 500 messages of banter in between.

### ⚡ 4. The User (Smart Catch-Up)

* **The Hook:** "50 Missed Messages? Caught up in 5 seconds."
* **Function:** One-tap summary of everything you missed.
* **Output:** Bullet points of key decisions, drama, and mentions. No scrolling required.

### 🎨 5. The Artist (In-Chat Generation & Reactor)

* **Function:** Turn text into art and memes instantly.
* **Slash Commands:** Use `/image [prompt]` to generate high-quality AI art or `/meme [prompt]` to create viral content.
* **Reactor:** Remix any image in the chat. Glitch it, meme it, or reimagine it using AI-powered filters and prompts.
* **Visuals:** Powered by Gemini, enabling limitless visual creativity directly in the message stream.

### 📅 6. The Planner (Events, Polls, & Calendar)

* **Function:** Turn "We should hang out" into "It's on the calendar."
* **Polls:** Create instant polls to decide on dates, locations, or food choices.
* **Event Intelligence:** Create beautiful "Liquid Glass" event cards that track RSVPs (Going, Maybe, No).
* **Calendar Integration:** One-tap export to Google/Apple Calendar (.ics). Seamlessly syncs your chat plans with your real life.

* **UI Elements:**
  * Frosted glass message bubbles with glowing borders.
  * Floating inputs and headers (no solid bars).
  * Smooth, physics-based animations and haptics.
